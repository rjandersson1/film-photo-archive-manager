metadata script todo

- eventually be able to copy over and organize metadata for all photos so they are uniform
- plot ratings over time 
	- re export older photos to access ratings
- plot cost over time
	- film cost lookup
	- dev cost lookup
- look into geotagging photos so I can see a map? check what python libraries exist
- save a copy of import data so I don't have to import each time?
- time to import
- percentage complete on import (generally add more updates etc)
- way to generate a digital contact sheet?

-----------
- move top info (eg. number) to top right, so when filed away it is easily read.
- change dates to YY.MM.DD
	--> done: scraped date string, split '20' and took [-1] from vec (lol)
- cross reference completion status of roll metadata (list them all out on the back with a table of sorts)
- build VC identifier
- ensure images load in correct order
	--> done: bug was that index != exposure number, it was just file load order. Needed to scrape exposure # from filename, then added it to self.film_roll.image_data[i]['exposure']
- finalize BW
- build objects for each film emulsion; eg. G200 = (font color, font type)
	- have different rolls have ever so slightly different rebate colors
