metadata script todo

- eventually be able to copy over and organize metadata for all photos so they are uniform
- plot ratings over time 
	- re export older photos to access ratings
- plot cost over time
	- film cost lookup
	- dev cost lookup
- look into geotagging photos so I can see a map? check what python libraries exist
- save a copy of import data so I don't have to import each time?
- time to import
- percentage complete on import (generally add more updates etc)
- way to generate a digital contact sheet?

-----------
- move top info (eg. number) to top right, so when filed away it is easily read.
- change dates to YY.MM.DD
	--> done: scraped date string, split '20' and took [-1] from vec (lol)
- cross reference completion status of roll metadata (list them all out on the back with a table of sorts)
- build VC identifier
	--> could work with indetifying files with identical times...? This should be done on a roll import basis. VC should have exposure counts eg. 7 --> 71, 72, 73, or 14 --> 141, 142, 143, 144 (maybe..?)

		--> here, #9 is a panorama of 7,8,10 and needs to be excluded!
- ensure images load in correct order
	--> done: bug was that index != exposure number, it was just file load order. Needed to scrape exposure # from filename, then added it to self.film_roll.image_data[i]['exposure']
- finalize BW
- build objects for each film emulsion; eg. G200 = (font color, font type)
	- have different rolls have ever so slightly different rebate colors
	- emulsion = (bnw, font_color, font_name)
	--> render_rebates in Renderer.py needs to be updated on line 249: <# TODO: if self.roll.process == 'bnw': set image to bnw!>
		--> do this maybe with adding 'process' to roll metadata based on stock.
		....... nvm.... bigger development: needs to be done w work on RollMetadataDef.py and FilmCollectionDef.py, some # TODO functions need to be built and this can be implemented there...
- rollA.get_info_images() needs to be reworked! index != exposure count... core issue in building the roll. Need to have a simple 'sort by date' option.


--------------------------------------
- reworked def _process_image_metadata(self) to correctly identify different fileName strings and extract relevant metadata, including exposure index.
	- at the end, sort the dict by date-time.
- I really should rework each image to be an object within the roll... would help with grabbing metadata and exif...


----------------------------------------
- finalized ImageMetadataDef.py
- need to rework RollMetadataDef.py for implementation of image object and clean it up
- need to rework and clean up FilmCollectionDef.py for data scraping
- need to build bulk exif grabbing on a roll basis
- need to implemnent duplicate checking on a roll basis
- need to handle duplicates:
	- link each exposure to its relevant raw file
	- check if multiple exposures have the same raw file
	- if yes, set the original as the one with the oldest dateCreated
	- set copies as any others, indexing from 0 by order of dateCreated
	- nest copies into original (original --> copies), and create link between copies --> original
	- classify duplicate type
		- recrop, pano, stitch, reprocess
	- build getCopies() method --> returns vector of copy addresses, indexed from 0 
	- rebuild exposure list and indexing
	- cast flags back onto roll
- build DF row for each image
- build DF for a roll based on each image
long term:
- add filtering and handling onto some web based app
	
	

22. Aug 2025

- fix all relevant TODOs
- fix importer to only import select rolls
- implement ability to re-export rolls into new (cleaner) dir
- build stocklist and camlist
	- maybe use a excel file in /data/ ?
	- scrape current one?

- fix stocklist key mismatches
- fix importer to handle older rolls & also select which rolls to import...
