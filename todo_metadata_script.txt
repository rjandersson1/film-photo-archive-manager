metadata script todo

- eventually be able to copy over and organize metadata for all photos so they are uniform
- plot ratings over time 
	- re export older photos to access ratings
- plot cost over time
	- film cost lookup
	- dev cost lookup
- look into geotagging photos so I can see a map? check what python libraries exist
- save a copy of import data so I don't have to import each time?
- time to import
- percentage complete on import (generally add more updates etc)
- way to generate a digital contact sheet?
